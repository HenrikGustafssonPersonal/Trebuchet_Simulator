# Trebuchet_Simulator
This is a group project created in 2022 to model and simulate the physics  of a trebuchet.
The simulation considers the rotational movement of the lever and counter weight, the ballistic trajectory and air resistance.


This project was created using the physical formulas for torque, moment of inertia  and equation of motion for the rotational movement. The simulated trajectory was  calculated using Euler approximation.

## Visualization
The simulated trajectory of the launched object was used as a driving force for a visualization in blender. The x and y position of the object was exported from Matlab and imported into blender using a python script.
